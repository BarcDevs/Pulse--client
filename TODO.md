## CRITICAL — Replace Mocks in Active Pages

Replace hardcoded mock data with real API integration for pages with enabled features.

| # | File | Feature | Mock Data | Note |
|---|------|---------|-----------|------|
| ~~1~~ | ~~`src/components/dashboard/community/CommunityActivity.tsx`~~ | ~~forumLinking~~ | ~~`COMMUNITY_ACTIVITY_FEED`~~ | ~~Community activity feed mock — integrate with real forum posts API~~ |
| ~~2~~ | ~~`src/components/dashboard/cards/DailyObservation.tsx`~~ | ~~motivationFeedback~~ | ~~"5 minutes of mindfulness" (hardcoded in messages/en-US.json:306)~~ | ~~Replace hardcoded suggested activity with real API data from activity suggestions endpoint~~ |

## AI / Reflective Insights

The `DailyObservation` card currently shows a static hardcoded description. This is temporary.

**MVP goal:** Replace with a small AI-generated reflective insight card derived from:
- Deterministic backend signals (top activities, mood trend, streak, check-in frequency)
- Lightweight AI phrasing (short, calm, observational)

Card must stay: **small · passive · reflective · observational · calm**

No recommendations, no "you should", no pseudo-coaching.
The card reflects the user back to themselves — it does not instruct them.

| # | File | Note |
|---|------|------|
| ~~1~~ | ~~`src/components/dashboard/cards/DailyObservation.tsx`~~ | ~~Replace static `observation` with AI-generated reflective insight from backend. Backend derives insight from check-in signals; client renders as-is.~~ |

**Scaling-deferred — do NOT build until data maturity + trust calibration:**

Behavioral intelligence systems require medical/legal caution, behavioral tuning, repetition management, and data maturity. Deferred entirely to scaling phase:
- Recommendation engines
- Predictive suggestions
- Adaptive wellness coaching
- Intervention systems
- Proactive AI guidance
- Emotional diagnosis
- Personalized recovery plans
- Conversational coaching loops

## API / Backend

| # | File | Line | Note |
|---|------|------|------|
| 1 | `src/components/profile/settings/BasicInfoView.tsx` | 37–39 | Add `dateOfBirth`, `recoveryType`, `careProvider` once API supports them |
| 2 | `../healease--server` | — | `GET /forum/recommendations` should always return posts — currently returns empty `posts: []` when `status: "processing"` causing blank community activity card |
| 3 | `../healease--server` + `src/context/ForumRepliesContext.tsx` | — | Add reply count to post API response (or dedicated endpoint) so "Show more replies" button can display exact remaining count instead of static label |

---

## Profile / Identity

| # | File | Line | Note |
|---|------|------|------|
| 1 | `src/components/profile/RecoveryIdentity.tsx` | 66 | Show user bio once seeded data replaced with real content |
| 2 | `src/components/profile/RecoveryIdentity.tsx` | 67 | Add health interests editing (`getProfileOptions` + `addInterests`/`removeInterest`) |
| ~~3~~ | ~~`src/components/profile/info/ProfileCard.tsx`~~ | ~~47~~ | ~~Hide camera upload button behind feature flag (image upload implementation deferred to scaling)~~ |

---

## Community

| # | File | Line | Note |
|---|------|------|------|
| ~~1~~ | ~~`src/components/community/`~~ | ~~—~~ | ~~Forum tweaks — add author badge next to post author name~~ |
| ~~2~~ | ~~`src/components/community/postDetail/`~~ | ~~—~~ | ~~Limit reply count — use expand button to show remaining replies~~ |

---

## Progress / Goals

| # | File | Line | Note |
|---|------|------|------|
| ~~1~~ | ~~`src/components/progress/ProgressPageContent.tsx`~~ | ~~18~~ | ~~Add error card to Milestones & Achievements section when API errors occur~~ |
| ~~2~~ | ~~`src/components/goals/form/GoalForm.tsx`~~ | ~~—~~ | ~~Replace native date input with shadcn calendar component~~ |
| ~~3~~ | ~~`src/components/shared/`~~ | ~~—~~ | ~~Create reusable `ErrorMessage` component for inline form root errors (currently inlined in `GoalForm`)~~ |

## Style / Design

| # | File | Line | Note |
|---|------|------|------|
| 1 | `.claude/design/resources/design-canvas.jsx` | — | Apply Claude Design's style guide to components (low priority) |
