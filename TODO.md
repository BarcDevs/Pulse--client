## CRITICAL — Replace Mocks in Active Pages

Replace hardcoded mock data with real API integration for pages with enabled features.

| # | File | Feature | Mock Data | Note |
|---|------|---------|-----------|------|
| ~~1~~ | ~~`src/components/dashboard/community/CommunityActivity.tsx`~~ | ~~forumLinking~~ | ~~`COMMUNITY_ACTIVITY_FEED`~~ | ~~Community activity feed mock — integrate with real forum posts API~~ |
| ~~2~~ | ~~`src/components/dashboard/cards/TodaysFocus.tsx`~~ | ~~motivationFeedback~~ | ~~"5 minutes of mindfulness" (hardcoded in messages/en-US.json:306)~~ | ~~Replace hardcoded suggested activity with real API data from activity suggestions endpoint~~ |

## AI / Reflective Insights

The `TodaysFocus` card currently shows a static hardcoded description. This is temporary.

**MVP goal:** Replace with a small AI-generated reflective insight card derived from:
- Deterministic backend signals (top activities, mood trend, streak, check-in frequency)
- Lightweight AI phrasing (short, calm, observational)

Card must stay: **small · passive · reflective · observational · calm**

No recommendations, no "you should", no pseudo-coaching.
The card reflects the user back to themselves — it does not instruct them.

| # | File | Note |
|---|------|------|
| 1 | `src/components/dashboard/cards/TodaysFocus.tsx` | Replace static `observation` with AI-generated reflective insight from backend. Backend derives insight from check-in signals; client renders as-is. |

**Scaling-deferred — do NOT build until data maturity + trust calibration:**

Behavioral intelligence systems require medical/legal caution, behavioral tuning, repetition management, and data maturity. Deferred entirely to scaling phase:
- Recommendation engines
- Predictive suggestions
- Adaptive wellness coaching
- Intervention systems
- Proactive AI guidance
- Emotional diagnosis
- Personalized recovery plans
- Conversational coaching loops
